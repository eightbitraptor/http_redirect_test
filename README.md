http\_redirect\_test
==================

Makes sure your apache set up is working as you expect it to and check for regressions by running a suite of tests against it just as you would for any web application.

Example
-------

simply subclass HTTPRedirectTest in your tests and set the domain that you want to test

    require 'http_redirect_test'

    class ExampleComTest < HTTPRedirectTest
      self.domain =  "example.com"
      # rest of tests here
    end

you then have access to a bunch of macros to test various responses from your chosen site.

      should_not_redirect "/index.html"                                   # tests response is a 200OK
      should_redirect "/blog", :to => "/new/blog", :permanant => true     # tests reponse is a 301 specifically
      should_redirect "/oldblog", :to => "/new/blog"                      # any kind of 3xx response
      should_be_gone "/410.html"                                          # explicitly 410Gone
      should_not_be_found "/404.html"                                     # explicitly 404
